# G.E.A.R Rabbit – Marker-Based AR Application

## 🐰 About G.E.A.R Rabbit

**G.E.A.R Rabbit** is a **marker-based Augmented Reality (AR)** application that brings 3D digital content to life by scanning a physical marker. When the camera of an ARCore-supported device is pointed at a designated marker (e.g., a printed image), a 3D animated rabbit model appears over the marker in real time.

This app serves as a fun and educational tool, especially for introducing students and children to AR concepts. The project combines computer vision and real-time rendering to superimpose virtual content onto real-world views.
